## Description

This project goal is to create a virtual arena, where programs written in a simplistic language will battle each other. You will approach the design of a VM (with instruction she can handle, the register, etc), and the issues related to compiling an assembly language in bytecode. With, as a bonus, the pleasure of seeing your champions compete in your arena !
