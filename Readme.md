# Portofolio 42

Also available in [French](Readme.fr.md)

This git repository contains most of my 42-school projects, with the descriptions available on the intranet.

A grade higher than 100 indicates that it contained bonuses (additional functionality rearding the mendatory part)

Sone projects (42sh, coreware, zappy) were made with a team, in which case the logins of my teammates and mine are in the file 'auteur'.
